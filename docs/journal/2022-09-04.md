# ViGEm, vGamePad, and DI-Engine

After literally doing nothing for like 8 months on this project, apparently, the required work was nevertheless "just happened". Remember, my original requirement was

- a platform to capture input video stream
- a way to send gamepad commands back to the stream

Both of these happened via the following

- Sony's Remote Play
- [vGamepad](https://pypi.org/project/vgamepad/#:~:text=Virtual%20Gamepad%20(%20vgamepad%20)%20is%20a,directly%20from%20your%20python%20script.) python library for emulating DS4 output
  - Built on top of [ViGEm](https://github.com/ViGEm)
- [DI Engine](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/00_intro/index.html) OpenAI's reinforcement learning framework

The scope of my project now is merely to learn these 3 frameworks, cobble them together, then connect them up to my PS4 to see if I can't get it play games for me

## Installing DI-Engine

Following the instructions from their site, I run into a version conflict while attempting to do

```sh
pipenv install di-engine
```

I get the following importlib-metadata error:

```
    raise VersionConflict(dist, req)
pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (importlib-metadata 4.8.3 (~/.local/share/virtualenvs/causality-pk4GMq_8/lib/python3.6/site-packages), Requirement.parse('importlib-metadata<2,>=0.12; python_version < "3.8"'))
```

Checking my Pipfile.lock, I see that

```
"importlib-metadata": {
    "hashes": [
        "sha256:ace61d5fc652dc280e7b6b4ff732a9c2d40db2c0f92bc6cb74e07b73d53a1771",
        "sha256:fa5daa4477a7414ae34e95942e4dd07f62adf589143c875c133c1e53c4eff38d"
    ],
    "markers": "python_version < '3.8'",
    "version": "==3.4.0"
}
```

I'm on version 3.4.0, which is instead outside the range of 0.12 <= allowedVersion < 2

Going onto github.com/opendilab/DI-engine and checking

```sh
pipenv graph
```

I see that redis is the library from di-engine that's causing this trouble, as such, going to see if I can't directly install it to save myself some trouble

This appears to be too major an issue for me to want to fix, as such, going just spin out a new project with a clean pipenv file
